    "longDescription": "Longjing (Dragon Well) is one of China's most prestigious green teas, dating back over 1,200 years. Grown in the mountains surrounding West Lake in Hangzhou, this tea is pan-fired by hand in traditional woks to create its distinctive flat, sword-like shape. The leaves produce a clear, yellow-green infusion with a gentle, sweet aroma reminiscent of roasted chestnuts. The flavor is mellow and smooth with notes of fresh vegetables and a slight sweetness, ending with a clean finish.",
